## Note
The data preprocessing that's done here is a fair bit messier than it really should be, and doesn't follow all the best ways we've now figured out to work with neural CDEs. We recommend instead looking at [torchcde](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde), and in particular the examples of torchcde, for the best ways to do things. (Including managing things like irregular data.)
