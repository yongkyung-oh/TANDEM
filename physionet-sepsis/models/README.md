## Note
The models that are built here are somewhat messier than they really should be, and don't follow all the best ways we've now figured out to work with neural CDEs. We recommend instead looking at [torchcde](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/torchcde), and in particular the examples of torchcde, for the best ways to do things.
